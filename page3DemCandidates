    <div class = "3a-info">
      <h3>Background: </h3>
        <p> Bernard "Bernie" Sanders (born September 8, 1941) is an American politician
           and the junior United States Senator from Vermont. He is a candidate for the
           Democratic nomination for President of the United States in the 2016 U.S.
            presidential election. A Democrat as of 2015,[2] Sanders had been the
             longest-serving independent in U.S. congressional history, though his
              caucusing with the Democrats entitled him to committee assignments and
              at times gave Democrats a majority. Sanders has been the ranking minority
              member on the Senate Budget Committee since January 2015, and previously
              served for two years as chair of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. (Wikipedia) </p>
